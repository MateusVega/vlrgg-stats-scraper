Both **all-champions-playoffs.json** and **all-masters-playoffs.json** are just examples and only count eliminations  
of players who qualified for the playoffs; therefore, any statistics for players who did not qualify for a specific  
Masters event will not be added to the statistics.

**career.json** is getting the career stats from all players who has been in the 22-25 champions playoffs.
Excluding just: **Upper Semifinals**, **Lower Round 1** and **Lower Round 2**.
